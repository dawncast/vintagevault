# My Personal Project 

A clothing item tracking application for a second-hand consignment store. It will let you enter information new clothing 
items that have arrived at the store as a way to keep track for the employees, and also let customers see what is 
available in-store without having to go into the shop themselves. Features include a list of all clothing items currently
in-store in picture-format, can be filtered based on clothing price and size.  

This is of interest to me because I love thrifting, and I would spend hours looking through everything.
Sometimes I wish there is a more efficient way to browse through everything or look for a specific item that I am 
looking for
